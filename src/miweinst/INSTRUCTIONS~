GRAVI-DOG INSTRUCTIONS



Use arrow keys to move around. The World's gravity changes according to the surface the player is on.

Use scrolling to zoom in and out.

Pick up the stars (yellow circles) and reach the end of the level by reaching the door (green rectangle). The door is locked until at least one star is picked up. 

In the Main Menu, press 'Play' to play the game, and press 'Reset' to play the game without any star stats.

The number of stars you earn for each level will be saved unless you press 'Reset' to start a new game from the Main Menu.
