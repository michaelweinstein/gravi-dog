Bug: Save data is supposed to be reset when Player quits. But only works when player quits with 'q' from playScreen; doesn't work when closing window. Didn't figure out how to do a shutDownHook(Thread)... So once you make it to the checkpoint, you're set for life.

Start a new game by pressing 'r' at any point. Can also quit with 'q'

Wayyy more than 5 I/O connections. Mostly because sensors, sensors everywhere.

FEATURES ADDED TO GAME

-Drawing and calculating points on Bezier Curves
	Uses an algorithm called de Casteljau's algorithm, which efficiently finds a point on the curve (I just have a CubicBezierCurve class). I also have methods to calculate the point directly using the BezierCurve equation.

-Circle-Curve collision detection using orthogonality check by vector dot product
	Collision detection with curve-circles. Not that efficient yet, but works by minimizing (through iterations, for now) the dot product between the circle's center and a point on the curve, because when dot product == 0 then the vectors are orthogonal, and therefore that point on the curve will be the closest. Works well but need to optimize it.

-Environmental Traps 
	Blue platforms disappearing when you jump on them
	Circular bumper shoots you off map if you touch it (it has a crazy high restitution)

-Basic Save/Load 
	Saves whether Player has reached checkpoint, and if so, loads player at checkpoint at the appropriate color (black if the player made it to the checkpoint)

-Ability to reverse gravity at some point in game
	When the player goes from one curve to the other, gravity will switch!

- Level is won by solving puzzle
	In particular, triggering the correct color-changing relay and then finding the win platform once that the relay has been triggered (and the Player is black). Also has false triggers, such as when the Player turns white in that place that you'll discover.
